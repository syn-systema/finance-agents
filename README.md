- Bollinger Bands with width calculation
- Multiple Moving Averages (SMA, EMA)
- Volume analysis and trends
- ATR (Average True Range) for volatility measurement

### 3. Advanced Indicators Agent (`advanced_indicators.py`)
Implements sophisticated technical indicators:
- Fibonacci Retracement levels
- Ichimoku Cloud components (Tenkan-sen, Kijun-sen, Senkou Span A/B, Chikou Span)
- On Balance Volume (OBV)
- Stochastic RSI
- Custom momentum indicators

### 4. Fundamental Analysis Agent (`fundamental_analysis.py`)
Focuses on company financial metrics:

  - Profitability (ROA, ROE, Net Margin)
  - Liquidity (Current Ratio, Quick Ratio)
  - Efficiency (Asset Turnover, Receivables Turnover)
  - Leverage (Debt-to-Equity, Debt-to-Assets)

  - Historical VaR
- Risk-Reward Ratio Analysis
- Portfolio Risk Assessment
- Stop Loss Optimization

## ðŸ›  Technical Architecture

   - Portfolio optimization

## ðŸ“Š Usage Example

```python
# Initialize the analysis system
analyst = FinancialAnalyst()
technical = TechnicalAnalysis()
risk_manager = RiskManagement()

# Generate analysis report
report = analyst.generate_analysis_report(
    symbol="AAPL",
    stock_info=stock_data,
    technical_data=technical_indicators,
    price_data=historical_prices
)

# Calculate optimal position size
position = risk_manager.position_size_calculator(
    account_size=100000,
    risk_percentage=2,
    entry_price=150.0,
    stop_loss=145.0
)
```
